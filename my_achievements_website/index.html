        <h2>My Objective</h2>
        <p>
            As a highly skilled and knowledgeable 16-year-old 4th year TY student currently enrolled at St. Patrick’s College, I exhibit a considerable talent for robotics, coding, and engineering. I have proficient skills in coding, specifically in Scratch, Python, and JavaScript, which are highlighted by my successful participation in numerous competitions related to these fields. My specialized focus is on mechanical engineering, a field in which I excel greatly. My core values revolve around loyalty, respect, honesty, fairness, and kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            My ultimate objective is to specialize as a mechatronics engineer, as it integrates all my interests. My passion and perseverance towards engineering are the driving forces behind my goals, nurtured since the age of 12 as I enjoy building, constructing, and innovating.
